This was\nall done using the harmonics of each chord.  So if someone tells you, “You’re\nplaying it wrong,” tell them to play along and it will match.  I promise.\nThat should just about do it.  If you’re a rhythm player and you don’t wanna be\nleft out when the band starts playing this song, then this is for you.  I didn’t\ntab the solos because I play lead guitar and I wouldn’t want anybody just copying\nmy solos.  It’s not fair to take those from Jimmy Page.  They’re a part of him\nand he’s a part of them.  So I’ll leave that to the imagination (after all, it’s\nalways improvised anyway).\nQuestions, comments, prayer requests, snide remarks? (ha, ha) E-mail me at midwine73@yahoo.com"

That is probably best if your gonna solo this as an acoustic singer and\nneed to focus on scrunching your face up when you sing. :P\n\nEdit: Lyrics have been fixed.\n\nEdit #2: Upon closer inspection and a few more sit downs at the piano and the guitar there is most\ncertainly a C7 chord in there and have added it in. However, it also sounds fairly good without it so do \nwhat you are comfortable with. \n\nChord Voicings No Capo:\n    F     Dmin     C     C7    Bb\ne|--1-------1------0-----0-----1---------|\nB|--1-------3------1-----1-----3---------|\nG|--2-------2------0-----3-----3---------|\nD|--3-------0------2-----2-----3---------|\nA|--3--------------3-----3-----1---------|\nE|--1------------------------------------|\n\nChord Voicings Capo 5th: \n     C     Am     G    G7    F             \ne|---0-----0------3----1-----1-----------|\nB|---1-----1------3----0-----1-----------|\nG|---0-----2------0----0-----2-----------|\nD|---2-----2------0----0-----3-----------|\nA|---3-----0------2----2-----3-----------|\nE|----------------3----3-----1-----------|\n\n---------------------------\n[Intro]\nF Dm C\n\n[Verse 1]\nF \nJust stop your crying\n                   Dm\nIt’s a sign of the times\n               C\nWelcome to the final show\n\nHope you’re wearing your best clothes\nF\nYou can't bribe the door\n                   Dm\nOn your way to the sky\n                C\nYou look pretty good down here\n\nBut you ain't really good...\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nF\nIf we never learn we've been here before\nDm       \nWhy are we always stuck and\n                   C\nrunning from the bullets\n       C7\nThe bullets...\n\nF\n  We never learn we've been here before\nDm       \nWhy are we always stuck and\n                   C\nrunning from the bullets\n       C7\nThe bullets...\n\n[Chorus]\nF \nJust stop your crying\n                   Dm\nIt’s a sign of the times\n              C\nWe gotta get away from here\n              C7 \nWe gotta get away from here\nF \nJust stop your crying\n            Dm\nIt’ll be alright\n                      C\nThey told me that the end is near\n              C7 \nWe gotta get away from here\n\n[Verse 2]\nF \nJust stop your crying\n                      Dm\nHave the time of your life\n                     C\nBreakin' through the atmosphere\n\nThings look pretty good from here\n\nF                             Dm\nRemember everything will be alright\n               C\nWe could meet again somewhere.\n\nSomewhere far away from here. \n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nF\n  We never learn we've been here before\nDm       \nWhy are we always stuck and\n                   C\nrunning from the bullets\n       C7\nThe bullets...\n\nF\n  We never learn we've been here before\nDm       \nWhy are we always stuck and\n                   C\nrunning from the bullets\n       C7\nThe bullets...\n\n[Chorus]\nF \nJust stop your crying\n                   Dm\nIt’s a sign of the times\n             C\nWe gotta get away from here\n\nWe gotta get away from here\nF \nStop your crying, baby\n            Dm\nIt’ll be alright\n                      C\nThey told me that the end is near\n              C7\nWe gotta get away from here\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nF\nIf we never learn we've been here before\nDm       \nWhy are we always stuck and\n                   C\nrunning from the bullets\n       C7\nThe bullets...\n\nF\n  We never learn we've been here before\nDm       \nWhy are we always stuck and\n                   C\nrunning from the bullets\n       C7\nThe bullets...\n\n[Bridge]\nF\n We don't talk enough\nDm\n  We should open up\nC                        Bb\n Before it's all too much\nF\n Will we ever learn\nDm\n We've been here before\nC                       Bb\n It's just what we know\n\n[Ending]\nF \nStop your crying, baby\n                   Dm\nIt’s a sign of the times\n             C\nWe gotta get away\n               Bb           \nWe got to get away \n               F\nWe got to get away\n               Dm\nWe got to get away\n               C\nWe got to get away\n\nWe got to!
